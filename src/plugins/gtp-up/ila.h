/* ila_route_ops define an interface to set ILA routes (e.g.

 * Functions are:
 *
 *   init	Inititialize ILA routing.
 *
 *   parse_args
 *
 *		Parse arguments specific to the backend dbif database
 *		implementation. This are assumed to be a subopts string.
 *		A logfile argument is used to log messages about
 *		bad arguments.
 *
 *   start	Start ILA routing system.
 *
 *   done	Done with routing system, any resources can be released.
 *
 *   set_route	Set an ILA route. Input is an ILA map key and value.
 *
 *   del_route	Delete an ILA route. Input is a ILA map key.
